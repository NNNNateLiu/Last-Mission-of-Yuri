--------------------------------------
This is a doc to illustrate what inside each folder
--------------------------------------
Materials - textures, material balls, shaders

Model - 3D models import from outside

Plugins - any functional stuff we bring from outside including unity assets package

Prefabs - just prefabs

Presets - I don't know what is that, so I did not touch it

Scenes - just scenes, if you want to try something your own, just create one in your folder

Scripts - all scripts me and laura coded

Settings - I don't know what is that, so I did not touch it

Next time when you add something in the project, try to put them in their own sorting folder.
